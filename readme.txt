A new (better) way to manage and deliver WordPress notifications to the relevant audience.

== Description ==

1. Allow WordPress core to send notifications to administrative users to give them feedback about changes in the system.
2. Allow plugin and theme authors to send notifications to administrative users to give them feedback about changes in the system
3. Prevent plugin and theme authors from abusing this notification system in “spammy” ways.
4. Allow WordPress users who have access to notifications to control which, how, and where they receive them.
