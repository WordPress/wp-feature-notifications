# Scripts for the WordPress Feature Notifications Project

## Generating demo data

The plugin is a demo of functionality and does not currently persist data to the WordPress database. The script to generate the demo data should be executed after running `npm install`, though the data can also be regenerated.

```sh
# to regenerate the demo data
npm run gen-demo-data
```
