# Notification Center for WordPress (Feature Project)

See [Trac ticket #43484](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43484).

## Development environment

Any WAMP/MAMP/LAMP local environment that works for WordPress development will be good enough.

However, it is possible to use the [wp-env tool](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/master/docs/designers-developers/developers/tutorials/devenv/readme.md#wordpress-development-site) developed by the Gutenberg team.

You will then need both Node.js and Docker installed on your computer. Read more about its usage in [WordPres/gutenberg/packages/env/README.md](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/master/packages/env/README.md).
